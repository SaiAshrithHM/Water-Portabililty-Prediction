# Water-Portabililty-Prediction
A machine learning model to predict water portability based on various water parameters (safe or unsafe).

**The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model to predict water potability based on various wat parameters. This model will help in assessing whether water is safe for consumption, which is crucial for public management.**

The dataset used in this study contains **nine crucial water quality indicators**:  

- **pH** – Measures the acidity or alkalinity of water, affecting its suitability for consumption.  

- **Hardness** – Indicates the concentration of dissolved minerals like calcium and magnesium.  

- **Solids** – Represents total dissolved solids (TDS), which can influence water taste and safety.  

- **Chloramines** – A disinfectant used to treat water but can be harmful at high levels.  

- **Sulfate** – A naturally occurring substance that, in excess, can lead to gastrointestinal issues.  

- **Conductivity** – Measures the water's ability to conduct electricity, linked to ion concentration.  

- **Organic Carbon** – Indicates the presence of organic contaminants, which may impact water quality. 

- **Trihalomethanes (THMs)** – Byproducts of chlorination, known to pose health risks at high levels.
  
- **Turbidity** – Measures water clarity, with high values indicating potential contamination.  

The objective of this project is to **develop an accurate classification model that predicts water potability** based on these attributes. By analyzing large-scale water quality data, the model will help **identify non-potable water sources, support regulatory compliance, and optimize water treatment processes**.  

The successful implementation of this predictive system could have a profound impact on **public health, water resource management, and environmental sustainability**. It can assist water treatment facilities, regulatory bodies, and local communities in making **data-driven decisions to ensure the availability of safe drinking water**.
